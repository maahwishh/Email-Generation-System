10-Agent Email Generation System with RAG
📄 10-Agent Email Generation System with RAG — Documentation

🚀 Overview

This system leverages a multi-agent architecture to intelligently generate high-quality, personalized emails across various use cases (business, marketing, support, etc.). It integrates LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI LLMs with a RAG-enhanced knowledge base to ensure contextual relevance, stylistic accuracy, and personalization.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Install all required libraries:

pip install --upgrade langchain langchain-community langchain-openai langgraph
pip install --upgrade openai gradio pandas matplotlib seaborn faiss-cpu
pip install --upgrade pydantic typing-extensions datetime
pip install pandas==2.2.2
Set the OpenAI API key:

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."  # Replace with your key
🧠 Architecture

Agents
The system includes 10 specialized AI agents:

Agent #	Name	Role
1	EmailContextAnalyzer	Analyzes purpose, urgency, and key points
2	RecipientProfiler	Builds recipient profile for personalization
3	ContentStrategist	Outlines messaging and structure
4	ToneStyleAgent	Defines tone and stylistic rules
5	SubjectLineGenerator	Creates compelling subject lines
6	EmailStructureAgent	Organizes layout and logical flow
7	ContentWriterAgent	Writes the actual email content
8	RAGInsightsAgent	Augments with best practices from a vectorized knowledge base
9	PersonalizationAgent	Personalizes the draft with tailored details
10	QualityAssuranceAgent	Assesses quality and offers improvement suggestions
🔧 Custom Tools

1. EmailTemplateLibrary
Provides structural and tonal templates based on email type (business, marketing, etc.).

2. PersonalizationDatabase
Returns personalization parameters based on recipient type (executive, customer, etc.).

3. RAGKnowledgeBase
Vector store (via FAISS) populated with email best practices. Supports queries like:

"best practices for business emails"
"subject line optimization"
🔄 Workflow Orchestration

Implemented using LangGraph:

StateGraph(EmailState)
The agents are chained sequentially with a clear entry and exit point (END). Each agent updates the shared EmailState.

🧩 EmailState Schema

A TypedDict maintaining shared data such as:

email_type, recipient_info, email_purpose
context_analysis, content_strategy, email_content
rag_insights, quality_score, agent_logs, etc.
🖼️ Gradio Interface

Key Inputs:
Email type, tone, urgency
Recipient details
Purpose and key points
Outputs:
Generated email (HTML preview)
Subject line options
RAG insights
Agent logs (for transparency)
🧪 Example Usage

workflow = EmailGenerationWorkflow()

email_request = {
    "email_type": "business",
    "recipient_info": {
        "name": "Alice",
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "type": "executive"
    },
    "email_purpose": "Request budget approval",
    "key_points": ["Project justification", "Cost breakdown", "ROI"],
    "tone_preference": "professional",
    "urgency_level": "high"
}

result = workflow.generate_email(email_request)
print(result["email"]["content"])
